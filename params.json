The activity doesn't display anything. \r\n\r\nA SMS Receiver captures all SMS messages and parse them before the default SMS application does its duty. This also works even if the activity is not running foreground.\r\nIf a SMS has the following structure :\r\n+ 1st line = FORWARD\r\n+ 2nd line = a phone number (not controlled yet)\r\n+ 3rd line = a string message (not controlled yet.. has sure to be)\r\n\r\nthen the SMS Receiver creates a new SMS using the following structure :\r\n+ destination number provided on 2nd line of the previous SMS\r\n+ content body of the SMS provided on 3rd line of the previous SMS\r\n\r\nExample of message :\r\nFORWARD\r\n+33626262626\r\nSay Hello To SMS Forwarder\r\n\r\n## How to test (French FreeMobile users)\r\nFirst have a look at : http://www.freenews.fr/freenews-edition-nationale-299/free-mobile-170/nouvelle-option-notifications-par-sms-chez-free-mobile-14817\r\nThis step is needed in order to activate the option.\r\n\r\nTo test :\r\nhttps://smsapi.free-mobile.fr/sendmsg?user=(free_mobile_user)&pass=(free_mobile_pass)=FORWARD%0d+33626262626%0dFREE\r\n+ user = your Free mobile ID\r\n+ pass = the passkey provided by Free\r\n+ msg = the message you have to send\r\n  + %0D are URL encoded cariage return (known as '\\r').\r\n  + %0A are URL encoded new line (known as '\\n'), but doesn't seem to be OK with SMS.\r\n\r\n## Future plans\r\n\r\n+ List of forwarded message in activity\r\n+ Control of phone number provided in source SMS\r\n+ Control of content provided in source SMS\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
